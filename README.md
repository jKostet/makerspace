## Makerspace Inventory & Updates page
The plan is to develop an inventory database for Kumpula Think Company Makerspace. Users of the Makerspace can browse a list of equipment, parts, tools and services available at the Makerspace, and wish-list equipment they would like. Administrators of the Makerspace can manage the inventory and post updates on Makerspace development, such as new equipment being available, maintenance notices or upcoming events.

Functions:
* Login (for Administrators)
* Browsing Inventory
* Managing Inventory (add, remove, update description)
* Browsing equipment Wish List
* Adding items to Wish List
* Approving Wishes/Requests
* Marking Wishes as fulfilled
* Posting updates to front page (updates as objects or just html edit via js etc?)
